  "motd": "Welcome to LunaSea v10.2.2!\n\nThis release adds support for official .deb and .tar.gz builds for Linux releases!\n\nThis build also fixes an issue with cached activity sessions in Tautulli and fixes cases where it would not automatically scroll to the current date in the calendar schedule view.\n\nFinally, this release has a UX change that disables the horizontal swiping to change pages on routes with a bottom navigation bar. This will allow future extensibility of the UX to utilize horizontal actions more cleanly!",
