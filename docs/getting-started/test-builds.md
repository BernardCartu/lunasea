# Test Builds

## Production

This is the store version and will remain the most stable version. The current release cadence will stay the same, and no in-progress features will be deployed to this track.

For users on macOS who want to download releases via TestFlight but do not want to use pre-release builds, you can now join the TestFlight (link below) for production-level builds while the application is not actually published to the Mac App Store.

### Links

* [Android](https://www.lunasea.app/playstore)
* [iOS](https://www.lunasea.app/appstore)
* [macOS](https://www.lunasea.app/testflight/production)
* [GitHub](https://www.lunasea.app/github)

## Beta

This is the current "test" version, and will be shifted to focus around **final testing of completed new features** leading up to the release to production. This track is intended to help catch any remaining bugs from alpha builds and overall should remain relatively stable.

### Android

1. Head to the [Google Play Store](https://www.lunasea.app/playstore)
2. Register for the test directly on the store listing
3. Download LunaSea via the Google Play Store

_NOTE: It may take a few hours to start receiving the updated builds_

### iOS/macOS

1. Download [TestFlight](https://apps.apple.com/app/testflight/id899247664)
2. [Join the TestFlight](https://www.lunasea.app/testflight/beta)
3. Download LunaSea via the TestFlight application&#x20;

## Alpha

This track's purpose is to allow **early previews and testing of work-in-progress features**. An example is the current localization efforts, so all users who have graciously helped translate pieces of LunaSea over the past few months can start to see their changes in the app! This is just a single example of a work in progress feature, and the feature list will constantly be changing.

## Develop

This track's purpose is to ensure that every commit made to `master` is building across all platforms and allows for easier access to a build for each commit. **This is not intended to be used by the average user**, but is for community developers or users who need to test a recently added fix that has not yet reached the alpha channel.

There are no restrictions on features in these builds (barring a very specific subset used for debugging/testing) so it gives full access to everything that is work in progress.

**Do not expect a fully stable experience if you use these builds**, as it is entirely possible that a single build could cause problems including but not limited to database corruption. _If you are running these builds, please ensure you have either a cloud or offline backup available for easy restoration._

### Android

Because of the limitations on internal testing set by the Google Play Store, develop builds on Android are only available upon request to a very limited amount of users.
